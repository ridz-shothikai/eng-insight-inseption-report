the maximum Technical score shall be declared as the most preferred
bidder (H-1). A bidder with a particular team can bid for a
particular package only. For bidding multiple packages, the

lesser team no.s bid for more packages, then bidder will be
considered for evaluation in packages with lower length.
In case work has to be awarded for multiple packages, award of work
to a Consultant with "a Particular Team" either as sole or as in
JV/Association shall be limited to one package only. At first,
Consultants who become H-1 in one package each shall be assigned the

awarded to H-2 bidders. Under no circumstances is the work to be
awarded to H-3 or lower ranked bidders Illustrations are as under:

km, 200 km respectively is invited wherein 4 bidders viz., A, B,
C, D participated and their Residual bid capacities of the bidders
are 500 km, 200 km, 150 km & 800 km respectively.
The technical result is as under:

In above result it has been assumed that each bidder has

residual bid capacity of the bidder is more than the individual
length of packages for which the bidder has submitted the bid.
All bidders have bid for all 5 packages with 5 different teams.
Bidder C has not been considered eligible for Pkg-1 & Pkg-5 as
its Residual bid capacity is 150km but package lengths are 300
km and 200 km respectively.
The award of work shall be as under:
Pkg 1: To be awarded to A
Pkg 2: To be awarded to A
Pkg 3: To be awarded to A
Pkg 4: To be awarded to B
Pkg 5: To be Retendered (as H-2 bidder has exhausted is
residual Bid Capacity)
Note: Here bidder 'A' is not awarded Pkg-5 as it would have
exhausted the Residual Bid capacity of 'A' and a total of only
two packages would have been awarded to a H-1 bidder
including Pkg-1.
5.6.1 In case, two bidders have same technical score, then the bidder
with more Residual Bid Capacity (after award of other packages
in the bundle of bids to both bidders, if any) shall be awarded
the work. In case, the Residual Bid Capacity of the bidder is also
same then the bidder who has more local content, will be
awarded the consultancy assignment.

APPENDIX-I
TERMS OF REFERENCE (TOR)
Consultancy Services for preparation of DPR for Upgradation of NH27
(Jhansi-Orai) from 4 Lane to 6 Lane Divided Carriageway in the state
of Uttar Pradesh.
Terms of Reference for Consultancy Services (TOR)
1.
General
1.1 The NHAI has been entrusted with the assignment of Consultancy
Services for preparation of DPR for Upgradation of NH27 (Jhansi-
Orai) from 4 Lane to 6 Lane Divided Carriageway in the state of Uttar
Pradesh. NHAI now invites proposal from technical consultants for

4.  
    Scope of Services
    The general scope of services is given in the sections that follow.
    However, the entire scope of services would, inter-alia, include the
    items mentioned in the Letter of Invitation, terms of reference, general
    contract and any supplements and appendices to these documents.
5.  1 Row and Land related aspects
    3.1.1 The Right of Way norms for National Highways should be as under:
    (i) Expressways
    90
    m
    (ii) Economic Corridors and major National Highways requiring 70
    provisions for Service Roads and planned for expansion to m
    8-lanes
    (iii National Highways with planed capacity to 6-lane 60
    Configuration
    m
    (iv) National Highways with planned capacity to 4-lane
    45
    m
    (v) NH with planned capacity to two-lane + PS configuration 30
    requiring provision of Service Roads
    m
    3.1.2 In case of upgradation of an existing two lane Highway to a 4/6/8 lane
    configuration, a comparative cost-benefit analysis shall necessarily be
    carried out while recommending development of existing
    route/alignment vis-a-vis alternate option of a green -field alignment.
    While carrying out the cost benefit analysis of both the options, the
    following factors shall be considered:
    (i) Extant of land acquisition and the associated costs;
    (ii) Number of structures required to be acquired along their extant
    and costs.
    (iii) The quantum of utilities and costs required for their shifting.
    (iv) The extent of tree -felling and the associated cost & time for
    obtaining the requisite permissions.
    3.1.3 However, green-field option may not be resorted to in cases where
    growth of traffic is such that ultimate capacity does not require widening
    beyond 4 lanes in future.

--- Page 38 ---
3.1.4 In case the green field alignment option works out to be a preferred
option, then-
(i)
Entire ROW (60m -70m) may be acquired for a maximum
capacity of 8 lane main carriage way with provision for service
roads.
(ii) Initially 4 lane carriage-way with 4 lane structures shall be
developed with additional land left in the median for future
expansion.
(iii)
The highway shall have provision for service roads in inhabited
areas, preferably of 10 mtrs width, with maximum access
control for the main carriage way.
(iv) Access to the towns/cities/establishments located on the existing
National Highway, may be provided through spurs from the green
field route.
3.1.5 All efforts shall be made to avoid any road alignment through National
Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries, even if it requires taking a longer route /
bypass. However, where it becomes absolutely unavoidable and
necessary to keep the alignment through such reserve forest / restricted
areas, land would be acquired with RoW of not more than 30 mtrs.
3.1.6 Similarly, though it may be difficult, while determining the alignment for
any bypass, efforts be made to see if these could be along the revenue
boundaries of two revenue estates thereby minimizing the compulsions
of land owners / farmers for cross-overs to the other side. In case such
an alignment is not found feasible, it should be ensured that access to
common facilities for the local people (e.g. schools, Healthcare facilities
etc.) is maintained only on one side of the alignment, thereby
minimizing the need for cross-over for day-to-day life.
3.1.7 Protection of the acquired Row against any possible encroachments is
extremely important. Boundary stones be provided at the end of the
Row as per provisions of IRC:SP:84 and also supplemented as per
Circular dated 08.12.2015 issued by NHAI. The boundary pillars alone,
which are subject to removal with passage of time, may not be enough
to save against encroachments. As such, the typical cross-section of a
Highway Road is being re-visited separately with the intention of
providing permanent features in this behalf. For a typical RoW of 60
mtrs, starting from one end, these will require the following:
(a)
Use barricading of the RoW with plantation of hedge-like species
(Ficus / Poplars) within a 3m wide strip area, dug up to 0.6 to
0.9 mtrs, of which 2.0 mtrs to serve as a Utility Corridor.
(b)
Provision of a Service Road (along the inhabited area) with its
drainage slope towards the drain / area reserved for Strip
Plantation, for a width of 9.0 mtrs.
(c)
Earmark width of 1.5 mtrs for construction of a drain so as to be
able to capture the rainwater flow from the Service Road
(wherever provided) and the main carriageway.

--- Page 39 ---
(d) Three lane with paved shoulders: Main carriageway – 10.5 mtrs,
paved shoulder – 2.5 mtr and earthen shoulder – 1.5 mtr.
(e) Median – 5.0 mtrs (effective width 4.5 m), and
(f) A Mirror Image on the other end.
3.1.8 With regard to land acquisition, tree felling, utility shifting across the
alignment, Ministry's Guidelines issued vide letter no. NH -
15017/21/2018-P&M dated 10th May, 2018, or any amendment thereof,
may be adhered to.
3.2 Provisions of short bypasses, service roads, alignment corrections,
improvement of intersections shall be made wherever considered
necessary, practicable and cost effective. However, bypasses proposals
should also be considered, wherever in urban areas, improvement to 6
laning of the existing road is not possible.
3.3 Role and Responsibilities at different stages of Land Acquisition
The Consultant in the process of his deliverables, is expected to:
(i) To delineate and propose the most optimal alignment and take
care of geometrics of the road to meet safety parameters while
finalizing the DPR;
(ii) Identify and avoid (to the extent feasible) all such structures
(religious structures, public utilities cremation grounds, private
structures) in the RoW of the road project that could become
major hindrances at the time of project execution;
(iii) Procure or create digitized, geo referenced cadastral/land revenue
maps for the purpose of land acquisition activities. Where state
governments of local agencies have already digitize cadastral
maps, the consultant shall arrange to procure such maps. The
digitized map should exactly match the original map so that the
dimensions and area of plots can be extracted from the map
itself.
(iv) Co-ordinate collection of all relevant land revenue records
(including Khasra maps, Khatiyan, Jamabandi etc.) from the local
land revenue administration office required for preparation of
Draft notification under Section 3A of the NH Act.
(v) Identify and list all land parcels that need to be acquired as part
of project road. Conduct Joint measurement survey in conjunction
with CALA, the Executing Agency and the Land Revenue
Department to verify land records.
(vi) Assist the CALA and the Project Executing agency in preparation
of statutory notification under Sections 3A, the CALA during
hearing of objections received under Section 3C, recording of
hearings and completion of this process, preparation of draft
notification under Section 3D and completion of the LA process at
every stage, timely publication of notifications and public notices

--- Page 40 ---
in newspapers at every stage;
(vii) Clear identification and preparation of an inventory of the assets
attached to the land under acquisition (e.g. Structures, trees,
crops or any such assets which should be valued for payment of
compensation);
(viii) Co-ordination with offices of various departments like Land
Revenue Office (or Tehsil), Registrar office and other State
departments (public works department, horticulture department,
forest department etc.) for evaluation of assets (Structures, tree,
crops etc.) attached to the land and liaison with respective State
authority for authentication of the valuation.
(ix) Prepare and inventory of all the utilities (electrical/water supply
lines/gas pipelines etc.-
(x)
both linear and cross overs) and all such structures (religious
structure, public utilities, cremation grounds, private structures)
in the Row of the road project that could become major
hindrances at the time of project execution;
(xi) Carefully avoid location of any Flyover/VUP/elevated structure
where a high tension electricity line (66/132/220/400 KV etc.) is
crossing over so as to avoid raising of such line at such point,
while designing the road projects;
(xii) Assist in demarcation of the acquired land and installation of the
boundary stones/pillars/peg makings along the Row of the
alignment;
(xiii) Identification of land parcels missed out from acquisition in the
first round and assist the Authority and the CALA in preparation of
Draft Notification for acquisition of the land under missing plots.
(xiv) All Land Acquisition (LA) shall be done through empanelled LA
agencies. However, payment to such LA agencies would be made
by the DPR consultants. However, the responsibility of
Deliverables shall be solely that of the DPR Consultant.
Alternatively, in case the Consulting Firm itself satisfies the
criteria of empanelment or is itself empanelled as LA agency, then
there is no need to engage any other empanelled LA Agency.
Financial proposal of given the RFP is inclusive of the implications
for support team for CALA. Registration and empanelment of the
LAAgencies shall be done by NHAI. The rolling portal for the same
shall be available throughout the year without any closing date
for the purpose of registration and the evaluation. The
empanelment criteria for LA consultants is described as under:
a) Total Experience of Land Acquisition for Any Central/State
Government Agency in last 7 Financial Years: More than 1000
Hectares
b) Total Experience of Land Acquisition for Any Central/State
Government Agency under NH Act in last 7 Financial Years:
More than 225 Hectares
c) Experience in digitization of cadastral maps for land surveys in

--- Page 41 ---
last 7 Financial Years: More than 100 Hectares
d) Has atleast 5 on-roll Land Acquisition Experts in form of Retired
or Ex-Patwari Naib Tahsildars/ Tahsildars /SDM/ADMs (or
equivalent State Government Designations) and senior Officers
with at least 10 years of experience in their respective Post
e) Has defined LA sub-professional team on the regular roll of at
least 25 people (Excluding Experts) in the last 3 Financial Years
f) Should have average annual Turnover of Atleast 2.5 Crores in
last 3 Financial Years.
g) Experience of each member of JV shall be considered in
proportion to the JV share give in the Joint Bidding Agreement.
h) Empanelment shall only be of a sole firm and not of any JV or
Associate.
Note: Till the Empanelment process of LA Agencies has been
completed by NHAI, the DPR consultant shall utilise the
services of such agencies which fulfil the above said criteria
which shall be verified by Authority before commencement of
the consultancy assignment.
3.4 Approach to the provision and specifications for Structures:
3.4.1 The structures on roads viz. Bridges, ROBs (Road Over Bridges, and
Flyovers), RUBs (Road Under Bridges) etc. are designed for more than
50 years. It is difficult to increase the width of the structures at a later
date which may also have larger financial implications apart from
construction related issues in running traffic. Therefore, it has been
decided to keep provision for all the structures including approaches
comprising of retaining structures as 6-lane (length of such approaches
shall, in no case, be less than 30m on either side) on all the four-lane
highways except in the following cases (i) Reserve Forest (ii) Wild life
Areas (iii) Hilly Areas (iv) Urban Areas where site condition do not
permit this. Wherever elevated sections are designed through any
inhabited areas, these should be six-lane structures supported on single
piers so that the road underneath serves as effective service roads on
both sides.
3.4.2 Highway projects shall be designed for separation of local traffic
especially for Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs), for longitudinal
movements and crossing facilities through viaduct(s) located at
convenient walking distance. Provision of PUPs and CUPs with size of
7.0m x 3.0m, as specified in para 2.10 of the IRC specifications, has
proved to be insufficient keeping in view the increased use of
mechanization in agriculture practices. These structures do not support
the easy passage / crossing for the tractors with trolleys so often used
for agricultural operations. As traffic on cross roads is increasing day-
by-day, it has been decided to substitute the provision of Pedestrian
Underpass (PUP) / Cattle Underpass (CUP) [for para 2.10 of IRC
specifies the dimensions of 7.0m x 3.0m] with a LVUP with a minimum
size of 12 (lateral clearance) x 4m (vertical clearance). Out of 12m
lateral width, 2.5m width on one side shall be raised for pedestrian

--- Page 42 ---
sidewalks with grills to make pedestrian movement convenient and
safe. A third smaller dimension VUP-SVUP (4m*7m) for all cross roads
carriageway width lesser than 5.5m may also be considered. Thus VUPs
would be of three grades i.e.VUP-5.5mx20m; LVUP-4mx12m; and
SVUP-4mx7m These structures shall be located at the most preferred
place of pedestrian / cattle / day-to-day crossings. Depending on the
site conditions, feasibility of clubbing the crossing facilities through
service roads shall also be explored. Further, the bed level of these
crossings shall not be depressed as any such depression, in the
absence of proper drainage facilities becomes water-logged rendering
the same unusable. Ideally, the bed level of the crossings should be a
bit higher with proper connectivity to a drain, which could serve the
drainage requirements of the main carriageway, the underpass and the
service road as well.
3.4.3 Wherever the alignment of 4-lane Highway Road project is retained in-
situ while passing through inhabited areas (e.g. villages), it should be
ensured that Service Roads are provided on both sides of the
carriageway, connected underneath with a cross-over structure (VUP/
LVUP/SVUP). Thus each habitation should preferably have crossing
facility at the highways with a vertical clearance of 4 mtrs.
3.4.4 To ensure that bypass once constructed serves the intended purpose
during its life, all the bypasses shall be well designed and access
controlled. The entry / exit from / to side roads shall be controlled such
that they are grade separated at major roads or at spacing not less
than 5 kms. Side roads at closer spacing shall be connected to the
service roads on either side and taken to major roads for provision of
grade separated interchange.
3.5 The provision of embankments shall be kept minimum so as to save
land as well as earth which are scarce resources. This can be decided
on case to case basis with due deliberations. However, economic
considerations may also be given due weightage before deciding the
issue.
3.6 The Consultant shall study the possible locations and design of toll
plaza if applicable to the project. Wayside amenities Land (minimum 5
acres, length and depth preferably in the ratio of 3:2) shall also be
acquired for establishment of Way-side amenities at suitable locations
at distances varying between 30 to 50 kms on both sides of the
Highway. The local and slow traffic may need segregation from the
main traffic and provision of service roads and fencing may be
considered, wherever necessary to improve efficiency and safety.
3.7 The Consultant will also make suitable proposals for
widening/improvement of the existing road and strengthening of the
carriageways, as required at the appropriate time to maintain the level
of service over the design period. The Consultants shall prepare
documents for EPC/PPP contracts for each DPR assignment.
3.8 All ready to implement 'good for construction' drawings shall be
prepared incorporating all the details.

--- Page 43 ---
3.9
Environmental Impact Assessment, Environmental Management Plan
and Rehabilitation and Resettlement Studies shall be carried out by the
Consultant meeting the requirements of the lending agencies like ADB/
World Bank/JICA, etc.
3.10 Wherever required, consultant will liaise with concerned authorities and
arrange all clarifications. Approval of all drawings including GAD and
detail engineering drawings will be got done by the consultant from the
Railways. However, if Railways require proof checking of the drawings
prepared by the consultants, the same will be got done by NHAI and
payment to the proof consultant shall be made by NHAI directly.
Consultant will also obtain final approval from Ministry of Environment
and Forest for all applicable clearances. Consultant will also obtain
approval for estimates for shifting of utilities of all types from the
concerned authorities and NHAI. Consultant is also required to prepare
all Land Acquisition papers (i.e. all necessary schedule and draft 3a, 3A,
and 3D, 3G notification as per L.A. act) for acquisition of land either
under NH Act or State Act.
3.11 The DPR consultant may be required to prepare the Bid Documents,
based on the feasibility report, due to exigency of the project for
execution if desired by NHAI.
3.12 Consultant shall obtain all types of necessary clearances required for
implementation of the project on the ground from the concerned
agencies. The client shall provide the necessary supporting letters and
any official fees as per the demand note issued by such concerned
agencies from whom the clearances are being sought to enable
implementation.
3.13 The consultant shall prepare separate documents for BoT as well as EPC
contracts at Feasibility stage / DPR stage. The studies for financing
options like BoT, Annuity, EPC will be undertaken in feasibility study
stage.
3.14 The consultant shall be guided in its assignment by the Model
Concession/ Contract Agreements for PPP/ EPC projects, as applicable
and the Manual of Specifications and Standards for two/ four/ six laning
of highways published by IRC (IRC:SP:73 or IRC:SP:84 or IRC:SP:87,
as applicable) along with relevant IRC codes for design of long bridges.
3.15 The consultant shall prepare the bid documents including required
schedules (as mentioned above) as per EPC/ PPP documents. For that it
is suggested that consultant should also go through the EPC/PPP
documents of ministry before bidding the project. The Consultant shall
assist the NHAI and the Legal Adviser by furnishing clarifications as
required for the financial appraisal and legal scrutiny of the Project
Highway and Bid Documents.
3.16 Consultant shall be responsible for sharing the findings from the
preparation stages during the bid process. During the bid process for a
project, the consultant shall support the authority in responding to all
technical queries, and shall ensure participation of senior team
members of the consultant during all interaction with potential bidders
including pre-bid conference, meetings, site visits etc. In addition, the
consultant shall also support preparation of detailed responses to the
